John Lee was rushing to get his things packed. He was behind his planned schedule to get to the airport for his flight to Chicago were he was supposed to give a presentation of his new Invention.
He was stressed out as this was such an important event that he could not afford to mess up on. This was, in his mind, what was going to start his career. While packing he noticed that he could not find his wallet which caused even more panic and chaos.
He eventually finds his wallet and packs all his things and calls an uber to get himself to the airport. He gets through TSA and manages to just make it onto his flight to New York.
Just as the flight took off, he remembered that he forgot his son at the airport! He was immediately reminded of the movie Home Alone, a movie which he always criticized for being so unreal. He always said that no parent is foolish enogh to forget their child at the airport, but here he was, thinking he was the most foolosh person in the world.
He realized that it was too late to return back, so he continued on with his flight and left his son all alone. Back at the house, his son was having the time of his life.
He had all the candy and junk food in the world all to himself. He could watch TV all day and had no worries at all. This was until he heard a knock at the door. All of a sudden Jen Lee, John Lee's wife, bursts in after a long day of work. She yells, "Why are there no more Nacho Cheese Doritos in the cupboard? I just bought 10 bags yesterday, and I need some Nacho Cheese Doritos!" John's son was in huge trouble. No one takes away Nacho Cheese Doritos from Jen Lee. His heart sank as he knew the punishment that was about to come. Jen Lee stormed into the room where the son was caught Nacho Cheese handed. "Son," she said with a burning fire inside of her, "go to your room and eat some Cool Ranch Doritos!" The son sulked off to his room where he would stay for a full day, trying to finish one bag of Cool Ranch Doritos.
The end.
