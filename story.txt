John Lee was rushing to get his things packed. He was behind his planned schedule to get to the airport for his flight to Chicago were he was supposed to give a presentation of his new Invention.
He was stressed out as this was such an important event that he could not afford to mess up on. This was, in his mind, what was going to start his career. While packing he noticed that he could not find his wallet which caused even more panic and chaos.
He eventually finds his wallet and packs all his things and calls an uber to get himself to the airport. He gets through TSA and manages to just make it onto his flight to New York.
Just as the flight took off, he remembered that he forgot his son at the airport! He was immediately reminded of the movie Home Alone, a movie which he always criticized for being so unreal. He always said that no parent is foolish enogh to forget their child at the airport, but here he was, thinking he was the most foolosh person in the world.
